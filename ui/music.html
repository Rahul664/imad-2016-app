		<h2 style="color:red;">1) YOUTUBE MUSIC</h2>
	
	<article>
        <p>The new, ad-free YouTube Red subscription service that just arrived is only one part of Google's big re-imagining of YouTube taking place this year. The odd-duck YouTube Music Key service has graduated from beta and is being re-introduced as YouTube Music. The new app is available today for Android and iOS users, and you can use it whether or not you're signed up for YouTube Red.</p>
        <p>At first glance, YouTube Music is a bit of an enigma -- after all, Google already offers its own take on music streaming with Google Play Music. But after spending some time with the new YouTube Music app, it's clear that the new service isn't meant to mimic Google Play Music, Spotify, Apple Music, and all the rest. </p>
        <p>Instead, it's a music service for the millions of people who already do most of their music listening straight through YouTube itself. And if you're the kind of listener who likes to go deep down a band's rabbit hole, the wild depth of unofficial music on YouTube makes this app a lot of fun.<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwj1qFPnhow"></iframe></p>

	<h2 style="color:orange;">2) BLACK PALYER</h2>
	<p>BlackPlayer is a simple, but elegant music player that puts very little between you and your music. It operates on a tab structure and you can customize the tabs to use only the ones that you actually want. On top of that, it has an equalizer, widgets, scrobbling, an ID3 tag editor, no ads, themes, and support for most commonly used music files. It’s delightfully simple and a fantastic option for fans of minimalism. The free version is a little bare bones with the paid version providing far more features. </p>

    <h2 style="color:blue;">3) JET AUDIO</h2>
	<p>JetAudio is a long time favorite of Android users because it has enough features to be better than most, but still simple enough for everyone to use. This one features a variety of audio enhancements that come as plugins so you can tweak your music experience a little more than usual. On top of that, it comes with an equalizer (complete with 32 presets), simple effects like bass boost, a tag editor, widgets, and even MIDI playback. The free and paid versions are virtually identical with the paid version adding themes and removing advertising. </p>

    <h2 style="color:green;">4) MEDIA MONKEY PLAYER </h2>
	<p>MediaMonkey is a bit of a dark horse in the music player business. It has a ton of features, including organizational features for things like audiobooks, podcasts, and the ability to sort songs by thigns like composer (instead of just artist). It also has basic stuff like an equalizer. What makes MediaMonkey truly unique is the ability to sync your music library from your computer to your phone (and back) over WiFi. It’s a bit complicated set up, but it’s virtually a one-of-a-kind feature. The interface is simple and the app is an overall solid option.</p>

	<h2 style="color:yellow;">5) N7 PLAYER </h2>
	<div class="one-third">
	<p>n7player is an app that tries to do something a little different and succeeds. Instead of having lists of music sorted in various ways, n7player creates a giant collage style list of your music which you can scroll through and listen to. It also comes with a 10-band equalizer, volume normalization, a tag editor, scrobbling, and plenty of other features. A lot of this is definitely form over function so those looking for more powerful music management may need to look elsewhere. However, if you want something that looks awesome, this works.</p>
