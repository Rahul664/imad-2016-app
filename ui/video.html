	<article>
        <p> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast&hl=en">AllCast</a> is a video player that specializes in sending your locally stored content to your Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV, Xbox 360/One, and other DLNA compliant devices. Along with videos, it also supports other types of media. It has a bit of a rough start, but has quickly become one of the most stable casting apps out there. The free version has a five minute limit for content while the pro version has no limitations. You can also turn your Android device into an AllCast receiver (capable of being casted to) with the AllCast Receiver app.<p>
        AllCast is the hands-down best local media player for Android and Chromecast. Sure, there are other local media apps, including another favorite, Avia. The difference though is that AllCast has a built-in bitrate engine that buffers a video before playback, similar to YouTube or other video services.</p>
        <p>Overall, AllCast is a great app</p><iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5k_NLVrbxss"></iframe></p>

	<h2 style="color:orange;">2) MX PLAYER </h2>
	<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad&hl=en">MX Player</a> has long been the king of video player apps. It supported more formats long before other video player apps thought to do so and was also among the first to include things like hardware decoding, hardware accelerated playback, and other such features. It still has all of those things along with gesture controls (including pinch-to-zoom), subtitle support, a kids lock to keep your kids in the app watching their Disney movies, and it supports virtually every codec out there. Like MoboPlayer, it comes with additional plugins to add more functionality if you need them. </p>

    <h2 style="color:blue;">3) BS PLAYER</h2>
	<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bsplayer.bspandroid.free&hl=en">BSPlayer</a> has been around for a longer than most video player apps and has continued to be one of the best in all that time. It features multi-core hardware decoding, hardware accelerated playback, and support for streaming from network (DLNA) devices. On top of that, there is subtitle support, the ability to play files from compressed formats, and you can even have a pop-up window if you want to. The free version is ad-supported, but has all of the features. There are also additional plugins for even better support. If you want to get the full version </p>

    <h2 style="color:green;">4) MOBO PLAYER</h2>
	<p>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clov4r.android.nil.noplug&hl=en">MoboPlayer</a> is another one of those video player apps that has seemingly been around since dinosaurs roamed the planet. Therefore, it’s had plenty of time to iterate and improve over time. It claims to support all video formats (you may need to switch from hardware to software decoding sometimes) which is great news. It also support subtitles, playlists, continuous playback, and you can stream video through HTTP and RTSP protocols if you want to. There are additional plugins you can add to increase functionality, but it’s an overall solid offering. </p>

	<h2 style="color:yellow;">5) LOCAL CAST </h2>
	<div class="one-third">
	<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.stefanpledl.localcast&hl=en">LocalCast</a> is a competitor to AllCast and they perform a lot of the same functions. That includes streaming media from your device to a Chromecast, Xbox 360/One, Roku, Fire Stick, or Apple TV. Along with AllCast, it allows for streaming from cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox), and it should work on most DLNA compliant devices. This one is limited in its codec support to whatever the Chromecast can support so it likely won’t fix those woes if you have them. Even so, it’s one of only a few respectable video player apps that perform this function </p>
